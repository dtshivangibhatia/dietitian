						Hormones are important for regulating most major bodily processes, so a hormone imbalance can affect a wide range of bodily functions.
                    </p>
                    <p id="pcod">
						Polycystic ovarian syndrome or disease (PCOS/PCOD) is a hormonal disorder that affects women in their reproductive age. PCOS is a common health condition that affects teen and young women, it is seen in 1 out of 10 women in their childbearing age.  The reproductive system of women is controlled by the complex interplay of primarily five reproductive hormones namely estrogen, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, progesterone and luteinizing hormone. An imbalance within these hormones leads to a hormonal disorder called the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD) among women of reproductive age.
						Along with havoc in female hormonal control, ovaries release abnormal amounts of androgen (male hormones). This hormonal breakdown results in irregular or prolonged menstrual periods, excessive body hair, acne and hair loss. Polycystic ovaries may fail to develop follicles and regularly release eggs, causing difficulty in conceiving a pregnancy.
					   Shivangi can assist you in the treatment of disorders caused by hormonal imbalances, such as PCOS/PCOD, diabetes and thyroid illness and the diet plan will be customized as per your taste preferences, local food availability and most importantly – your fitness goals.

						The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing substantially which is becoming a cause of grave worry and concern for health care providers in India owing to the humongous costs involved in management and treatment of diabetes and its complications, which affect various organs such as kidney, eyes, skin tissue, and pancreas. We also need to avoid the complications that Diabetes give especially after years of not treating it.
						In Diabetes Management plan the diet will be planned after taking into consideration the likes and dislikes of the patients with low glycemic index and low glycemic load foods in order to maintain stable and desirable glucose levels. As the Diabetic people may experience considerable oxidative stress and also to combat the free radicals in their bodies the diet planned will be rich in antioxidants such as polyphenols.                    </p>

                    <p>
                      With the rise of the industrial and packaged food industry
                      we are also seeing a boom in metabolic diseases such as
                      thyroid.
                    </p>
                    <p id="thyroid">
                      Hypothyroid is a medical condition in which the thyroid
                      gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. Despite the
                      fact that this hormone is necessary for growth, repair,
                      and metabolism. As a result, hypothyroidism causes
                      fatigue, dry skin, diarrhoea, and the ability to gain
                      weight quickly. Hyperthyroid is a medical when your
                      thyroid gland produces more thyroid hormones than your
                      body requires, which is also known as hyperactive thyroid.
                      The thyroid gland is a tiny butterfly-shaped gland located
                      at the front of the neck. Thyroid hormones affect almost
                      every organ in the body, including the rate at which your
                      heart beats, as they manage how the body consumes energy.
                      The thyroid usually causes slow metabolism. As per
                      research, focuses on the right diet and exercise can help
                      you boost your thyroid hormone activity. Shivangi’s goal
                      is to correct metabolic derangements and reverse clinical
                      progression as indicated with normal blood levels of
                      thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (T4).
                      The thyroid Management Plan is designed in such a way that
                      a person can not only achieve weight loss but also fulfill
                      the nutritional requirement as per the lifestyle and
                      dietary preferences. The diet plan will be customized as
                      per your taste preferences and availability of local food.

						but those who actively participate in sports need to understand that it can also affect their performance. An athlete needs more calories than the average person or individuals for bodybuilding competitions may need to increase the protein intake.
						Guideline for sports nutrition can result in improved performance, injury prevention, and faster recovery but it’s difficult to know where to start with so much conflicting information readily available. That’s where the help of a professional nutritionist can aid your decisions, and ultimately improve your performance.
						To maintain a healthy weight and eating well for a sportsperson is crucial. This is where a nutritionist can be helpful in advising on losing weight for sport and performance: it’s common that people deciding to lose weight will strictly reduce protein, fat or calorie intake. This can not only have a negative impact on your performance, but it can severely harm your body.
						The Sports Nutrition program helps to design a personalized plan not only based on your age, gender but also based on lifestyle, day to day habits, type of event (sport), supplements and regular medication needs. The focus is to manage weight, promote good health, increase energy levels, promote growth, improve concentration and enhance recovery and to fulfill the nutritional requirement of a sportsperson

                      Younger adults are developing problems in maintaining a
                      healthy lipid profile.
                    </p>
                    <p id="cholesterol">
                      This is primarily occurring due to negligence of diet,
                      physical activity, and hormonal imbalance. It is not
                      uncommon to find young men and women who have erratic
                      lipid levels including high levels of LDL cholesterol
                      (also called bad cholesterol) and low levels of HDL
                      cholesterol (good cholesterol). Eating out regularly at
                      restaurants and from roadside stalls is associated with a
                      bulging belly and higher accumulation of liver fat.
                      Besides high intake of deep fried and oily foods such as
                      potato chips, papad, pakoras, donuts, etc, eating large
                      meals rich in carbohydrates are also associated with
                      elevated levels of bad cholesterol. Shivangi can help you
                      in maintaining your lifestyle by doing little moderation
                      in your diet and eating habits, also she will give you the
                      food stuff which are local, easily available and are of
                      your taste and likes.

						Managing Nutrition or Losing the post-pregnancy weight can easily be one of the most difficult and dreadful things for a woman to do. 
                    </p>
                    <p id="pregnant">
						Post Natal period is the time when nutrient needs are greater in order to fulfill the baby’s needs along with you. You might want to lose weight post-delivery but you need to be patient enough so that your baby gets the correct nutrition in their crucial growth stage. 
						Losing those extra pounds assumes topmost priority. Post-pregnancy days are filled with uncertainties and insecurities. Healing uterus, sleepless nights, and birthing scars. Although getting into the habit of eating healthy should always be followed, it is important to note that your body needs adequate time to recover from labor as well. A healthy diet is a key element of getting back in shape. You need to be careful about the food you intake after pregnancy.
						As a mother’s body needs proper nourishment to refuel the loss of various vitamins and minerals. During this phase, a lot of mothers face the problem of scanty milk supply and also the post-patrum depression is at bay. Shivangi focuses on providing a balance diet plan based on your age, activity level, and weight loss goals which help mothers increasing milk production, maintaining the nutritional needs and also making them heal faster.                    </p>

                      Almost everyone want to have a healthy mind, a lean and
                      fit body, and soft and supple skin.
                    </p>
                    <p id="detox">
                      In order to do this, you must combine a structured
                      training routine with a nutritionally balanced diet.
                      However, before doing anything else, it is necessary to
                      detox the body through a thorough cleansing process in
                      order to eliminate harmful toxins. Detoxification helps in
                      boosting your immune system and deeply cleanses your body
                      of all the accumulated waste that makes you vulnerable to
                      nausea, fatigue and skin problems. This 4-day Detox Plan
                      will help get you in stabilizing your insulin/blood sugar
                      levels in the body, giving rest to the digestive system,
                      no water retention, no bloating and complete detox.
